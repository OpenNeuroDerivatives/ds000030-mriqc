So press the first button if it's pointing left, and the second button if it's pointing right. You want to push the button fast, but sometimes, you'll hear a beep, and when you hear the beep you should try really hard to not push any button at all. It's equally important to try to go fast and to stop when you hear the beep, so if you're trying to stop every time it means you're going too slow. As long as youâ€™re stopping some of the time, though, it means you're doing a good job. Any questions?",

    "TaskDescription": "The Stop-Signal Task measures response inhibition, or the ability to inhibit a motor response that has already been inititated. Participants see a series of arrows that point to either the left or right, and press a left or right button, respectively. On a subset of trials (25%), a stop signal (an auditory tone) occurs at a variable stop- signal delay (SSD) after the beginning of the stimulus presentation, signaling the participant to withhold his/her response on that trial. Stop Signal Task Scan Details: Each Stop Signal session consists of 128 trials (75% Go trials). Each session includes two staircases, which represent the onset times for the stop-signal. For the first session, the starting ladder values are entered manually (and are taken from the pre-testing behavioral session). For the second session, the ladder values are taken automatically from the previous scan session. The duration of events (Go, Stop, and Null trials, which include ITI) were created with opseek and varies between approximately 50 msec to 4 msec (with an average of about 1.5 sec).",
